# Helix22
Helix22 is a novel cryptographic system, including cryptographic API, communication protocol and secure key-managment components. 
It has been developed by BlakFx (https://www.blakfx.com/).

This repository holds description and general information about Helix22, its advantages over existing cryptgraphic systems and protocols.

Helix22 exposes client-side cryptographic API in various languages.

* Helix22 API is C (using C99 standard) is located at : https://github.com/blakfx/helix22-api-c
    * It is forward compatible with all C/C++ programs using C11, C++98, C++03, C++11, C++14, C++17 language standards
* Helix22 API in Java is located at: https://github.com/blakfx/helix22-api-java
    * Helix22 Java API uses version 11 of Java runtime environment, and is forward compatible with all newer releases of Java standard


Sample integration use-cases of Helix22 API are documented at: https://github.com/blakfx/helix22-sample-use-cases
